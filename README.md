# LifeSchedule
An advanced utility for scheduling IRL Operating Systems
To be renamed "Backup Plan" by recommendation of my coworker, Kulwinder Atwal

## Planned Features
- specify different kinds of work. i.e:
  - needs to immediately be done
  - can be worked on
  - nice to work on
- Task specific needs over time period:
    - Debt (day/week/month/year)
    - Surplus (day/week/month/year)
- specify different kinds of priorities
- bind certain kinds of work to certain locations
- the concept of "regret" as a health status indicator (this is an example, in reality)
  - activities can have a "regret-index" where a positive number means they add regret at a certain frequency and a negative number means that they relieve regret
  - a lower regret threshold (you aren't doing enough work) and a higher regret threshold (you are being overworked)
  - of course, this would be configurable as will everything else to match the differences between different people
- multi-platform (in order of development priority)
  - unix CLI
  - PC GUI
  - mobile
- Object Oriented Accounts (still in early brainstorm)
  - Think of a family::
  - Each member has their own account with their own personal tasks
  - There is also a family account with tasks that are shared between family members (e.g: chores)
  - different members have different levels of responsibility (head of household, other parents, older kids, youngest kids, etc)
  - one kind of responsibility allows for making/editing certain tasks, adding tasks (kids need long term---e.g: tutoring---help with homework)
  - Another kind of responsibility makes one member have to do more work than others (this might be tuned based off skillsets)
- Integration with ConfigEngine?
