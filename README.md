An advanced utility for scheduling IRL Operating Systems

## Planned Features
- specify different kinds of work
  - needs to immediately be done
  - can be worked on
  - nice to work on
- specify different kinds of priorities
- bind certain kinds of work to certain locations
- the concept of "regret" as a health status indicator
  - activities can have a "regret-index" where a positive number means they add regret at a certain frequency and a negative number means that they relieve regret
  - a lower regret threshold (you aren't doing enough work) and a higher regret threshold (you are being overworked)
  - of course, this would be configurable as will everything else to match the differences between diffferent people
